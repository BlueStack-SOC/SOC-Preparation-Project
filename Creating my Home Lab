# SOC Analyst Learning Journey – Homelab Project

Hello, and welcome to the start of my SOC learning journey.

To give you a quick overview of what I’m currently bringing to the table:

- Basic Linux commands and OS installation
- Familiarity with core cybersecurity concepts (CIA Triad, networking fundamentals, account security)
- Limited experience using Cisco Packet Tracer
- Introductory pentesting exposure via Hack The Box
- Foundational theoretical knowledge across multiple cyber domains

As you can see, my experience so far is broad but not yet deep. I’ve spent a lot of time learning theory, but now it’s time to apply that knowledge through practice and real-world simulation.

To begin, I’ll be building a basic homelab using Oracle VirtualBox. The goal is to simulate common attacks, capture and analyze network traffic, and document my findings — all to build the practical skills needed for a SOC role.

### Tools & Platforms I’ll Be Using:
- VirtualBox
- ParrotOS (Not Kali, just preference.)
- Windows 10
- Wireshark, TCPDump, Nmap
- (Eventually) Suricata or Security Onion

---

### Learning Resources:
- PracticalNetworking.net
- OWASP Top 10
- **Shoutout** to [MyDFIR’s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kku0fVfksrk) for helping guide this process.

This repo will serve as a log of my progress, lab setups, attack simulations, and write-ups.

Let's get to creating this home lab.

### Creating the home lab:
The first things I did were;
- Launch Oracle VirtualBox (Already installed from previous projects)
- Download ParrotOS
- Download Windows Media Creator (For the Windows 10 ISO)
