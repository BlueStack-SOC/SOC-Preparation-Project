Hello, future Hiring Managers. It's me, BlueStack, and if you're looking at this you probably already know who I am and which certs I have.

But for everybody else, this is intended to serve as a guide on how I'm learning SOC analysis using online resources, AI and my own learning.

So before I put my roadmap below, I want to explain what I'm planning to achieve with this project and why I'm doing what I'm doing instead of spending money on certifications.


====IF YOU DO NOT CARE, SKIP TO LINE 40 WHERE THE ROADMAP BEGINS.====

In the modern cybersecurity landscape, one thing has become clear: jobs are hard to come by. But people often misattribute why that is.

According to my research, the main reason cybersecurity roles go unfilled isn't simply due to a lack of certifications. Sure, you might have a bachelor’s degree in computer science and a few certs like Security+ or CySA+, but that alone won’t get you hired.

Certifications might get you flagged for further review, but one crucial thing many beginners (myself included) often overlook is the hands-on skills. You can go to university, pay tens of thousands of dollars, learn all the theory and still find yourself without a job. 
That’s because, while studying, you likely didn’t have time to do home lab projects or learn the actual tools used in roles like SOC Analyst.

So, as a student, I’ve decided to veer off the traditional path a bit. Rather than focusing solely on certs or formal education, I’m pursuing a hands-on approach centered around building valuable, demonstrable skills before I land my first role.

Now, don’t get me wrong - getting an entry-level job in cybersecurity is still difficult, even with experience. And you’re probably not going to be earning six figures right away. Unless you go into government or defense, the chances of getting swept off the street
into a high-paying SOC job are exceptionally low.

But that’s not what this project is about.

This is a slow, methodical process to build the skills needed to get a foot in the door. I will consider this project “complete” if the following conditions are met:

-I am offered a job at a legitimate vendor (So no Telegram job scams)
-I have completed all of the items I have set myself on the roadmap
-I apply using the GitHub repositories on this project as proof of my competence

Now obviously, in cybersecurity, learning never concludes. You can never have experience in everything, and the best in cybersecurity acknowledge the fact that this field is impossible to completely master. Every day, new CVEs are being discovered, and with the advent of AI
attacks are becoming more commonplace and sophisticated. 

It is now possible for a complete beginner to create their own malware using clever prompting or jailbroken AI agents. There is no doubt that this new and emerging technology will cause a significant spike in Ibuprofen sales with cybersecurity professionals worldwide. This is one
aspect I plan to integrate into my roadmap, and while I don't have access to sophisticated AI agents that can serve as a threat actor in something like a home lab exercise, I will try to get as close as possible to what such an attack could look like.

After all, defending against AI-driven attacks will become more and more relevant to SOC work as time goes on, especially at smaller companies that may not have the resources to defend against such a rapid and sophisticated attack like larger organizations do.

Now with the pretext out of the way, let me demonstrate the roadmap I will follow.

====THE ROADMAP====

1. Foundations of Cybersecurity & Networking
To build a solid baseline before diving into tools and workflows, I’m starting with networking, protocols, and the basics of cyber threats.

Practical Networking (practicalnetworking.net)

OWASP Top 10

Tools I'll Use:
Wireshark
Nmap
VirtualBox or VMware
TCPDump

Project:
Analyze PCAP files and generate reports identifying suspicious traffic
Build a virtual lab with Windows and Linux machines and capture baseline and attack traffic
Document network attacks like ARP spoofing or DNS poisoning using Wireshark

2. SIEM (Security Information & Event Management)
Understanding how to collect, aggregate, and analyze logs is key to any SOC role. I’ll be focusing on tools like Splunk and the ELK stack.

Learning Resources:
Splunk Fundamentals 1 (Free course)
Elastic Security documentation
Graylog tutorials
CyberDefenders SIEM labs

Tools I'll Use:
Splunk Free
ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
Sysmon (for generating logs)
Winlogbeat

Project:
Build a basic SIEM lab using VMs and feed in Windows and Linux logs
Write detection rules for common attacks (e.g., failed logins, port scanning, privilege escalation)
Create dashboards and a writeup explaining each detection rule I implemented

3. Endpoint Detection & Incident Response (EDR/IR)
SOC work often starts at the endpoint. I’m learning how to collect forensic artifacts and respond to suspicious activity on workstations.

Learning Resources:
The DFIR Report (case studies)
Malware Traffic Analysis
CyberDefenders Blue Primer
Velociraptor documentation

Tools I'll Use:
Velociraptor
KAPE
Sysinternals Suite
Autopsy

Project:
Simulate malware execution in a Windows VM
Collect memory and disk artifacts and analyze them
Write an incident response timeline and create visualizations of the attack path

4. Log Analysis & Threat Hunting
I'll be using real logs, SIGMA rules, and frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK to proactively identify suspicious activity.

Learning Resources:
MITRE ATT&CK Framework
SANS Blue Team cheat sheets
Huntress Labs blog

Tools I'll Use:
Sigma
MITRE ATT&CK Navigator
Kibana/Elastic SIEM
Event Viewer

Project:
Use logs from my lab to create threat hunting queries
Build and apply Sigma rules to detect common MITRE techniques
Document the hunt: hypothesis, queries, findings, false positives

5. Active Directory (AD) Security
Most organizations use AD — and many attacks start or escalate there. I’ll be practicing both offense and defense in AD environments.

Learning Resources:
TryHackMe Active Directory rooms
HackTheBox Tier 0/1 machines
DetectionLab GitHub project

ADSecurity.org

Tools I'll Use:
BloodHound
SharpHound
